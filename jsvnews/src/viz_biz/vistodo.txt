1) Clustering of all sources --
hope to see clusters match political leaning of what we'd expect

2) sentiment over time for, say, FOX + Trump, overlaid on sentiment of all publishers
(were there any dates they had way different take?),
maybe with some date-wise indicator of significance

3) Some analysis of volatility of subjects over time within publishers.
What's a difference in news cycle make?

4) clusterings of all newspapers per week, watch how they kind of float around.
